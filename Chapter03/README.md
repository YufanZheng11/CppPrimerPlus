## Notes

### std::cout display fixed floating precisions
```c++
cout.setf(ios_base::fixed, ios_base::floatfield); // fixed-point
```

### Floating value precision
Remember, floating-point constants are type **double by default**.
- float can guarantee about 6 precision
- double can guarantee about 15 precision
```c++
float a = 2.34e+22f;
float b = a + 1.0f;

cout << "a = " << a << endl;
cout << "b - a = " << b - a << endl;
```

The program in Listing 3.9 takes a number, adds 1, and then subtracts the original number.That should result in a value of 1. Does it? Here is the output from the program in Listing 3.9 for one system:
```
a = 2.34e+022
b - a = 0           // ---- float ignore the change of 1 at very end
```
The problem is that 2.34E+22 represents a number with 23 digits to the left of the decimal. By adding 1, you are attempting to add 1 to the 23rd digit in that number. But type float can represent only the first 6 or 7 digits in a number, so trying to change the 23rd digit has no effect on the value.

### Mod operator %
Both operands must be integer types; using the % operator with floating-point values causes a compile-time error.
```c++
// Good
int a = 210 % 10;
// Bad - causes a compile-time error.
int b = 20.1 % 10.2
```

### Potential Numeric Conversion Problems
| Conversion Type | Potential Problems |
| ---- | ---- |
| Bigger floating-point type to smaller floating-point type, such as double to float | Loss of precision (significant figures); value might be out of range for target type, in which case result is undefined.|
| Floating-point type to integer type | Loss of fractional part; original value might be out of range for target type, in which case result is undefined. |
| Bigger integer type to smaller integer type, such as long to short | Original value might be out of range for target, type; typically just the low-order bytes are copied. |
```c++
float tree = 3;
int guess = 3.9832;
int debt = 7.2E12;
cout << "tree = " << tree << endl;
cout << "guess = " << guess << endl;
cout << "debt = " << debt << endl;
```
```c++
tree = 3.000000
guess = 3       // fraction part missing
debt = 4098     // out of range
```

### Integral promotions 
```c++
short chickens = 20; // line 1 
short ducks = 35; // line 2 
short fowl = chickens + ducks; // line 3
```
To execute the statement on line 3, a C++ program takes the values of chickens and ducks and **converts 
both to int**. Then the program **converts the result back to type short** because the answer is assigned to a 
type short variable.You might find this a bit round about, but it does make sense.The int type is 
generally chosen to be the computerâ€™s most natural type, which means the computer probably does calculations 
fastest for that type.
```c++
9.0 / 5
```
Divides 9.0 by 5. Because 9.0 is type double, the program converts 5 to type double before it does the division.

### Type casts
```c++
(long) thorn // returns a type long conversion of thorn 
long (thorn) // returns a type long conversion of thorn

static_cast<typeName> (value) // converts value to typeName type
```
Stroustrup felt that the traditional C-style type cast is dangerously unlimited in its possibilities.
The static_cast<> operator is more restrictive than the traditional type cast.

### auto Declarations in C++11
use auto instead of the type name in an initializing declaration, 
and the compiler assigns the variable the same type as that of the initializer:
```c++
auto n = 100; // n is int
auto x = 1.5; // x is double 
auto y = 1.3e12L; // y is long double
```
Automatic type deduction becomes much more useful when dealing with complicated types, 
such as those in the STL (Standard Template Library). For example, C++98 code might have this:
```c++
std::vector<double> scores; 
std::vector<double>::iterator pv = scores.begin();
```
C++11 allows you to write this instead:
```c++

std::vector<double> scores; 
auto pv = scores.begin();
```
